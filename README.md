# Influence of the climatic niche on the rate of phenotypic evolution

## Main Question 
Does the climatic niche of vertebrates with dispersal abilities and with different thermal tolerances affect the evolution of body size?

## Hypothesis 
I expect that seasonality gradients of temperature and rainfall are important to differentiate the climatic niche of the species. Also, I expect niche to influence the rate of body size evolution differently in groups due to different thermal tolerances. This effect should be more pronounced for ectotherms (amphibians and reptiles) than homeotherms (birds and mammals).
