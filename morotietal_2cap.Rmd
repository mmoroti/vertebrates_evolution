Introduction
O tamanho do corpo de um organismo é um importante traço funcional para garantir a sobrevivência da espécie. 

Materials and methods
Phylogeny
To extract the rate of evolution of body size (Frogs) and mass (Squamates, mammals and birds) of vertebrates, we used the most comprehensive tree available in the literature for each group. We adopted this approach because the Atlantic Forest species pool did not evolve independently of other sister species that may occur in other biogeographical formations. For this reason, excluding and selecting only the pool of target species could impact evolution estimates, so we use the phylogeny with the most comprehensive trees as possible to infer evolutionary rates.
We used the consensus tree for amphibian containing 7,239 species of Jetz & Pyron (2018). For squamates, we used the fully-sampled consensus tree with 9,754 species of Tonini et al. (2016). For mammals, we used the fully-sampled tree of Upham et al. (2019). For birds, we used the tree proposed by Jetz et al. (2012), with 9,993 bird species. Birds are the only group to which a consensus tree is not provided. Thus, following Rubolini et al. (2015), we generated 10,000 posterior trees to 9,993 species based on the 'Hackett' backbone (Jetz et al., 2012). Then, we built a maximum clade credibility topology (MCCT) with the DendroPy and SumTrees packages in Python.  

Trait data
We obtained data on body size for amphibia, and body mass for squamates, birds and mammals from the following sources: i) amphiBIO (Oliveira et al., 2017) and Vasconcelos et al. (2019) for frogs; ii) Guedes et al. (2023) for squamates; iii) AVONET (Tobias et al., 2022) for birds; and iv) Elton Traits (Wilman et al., 2014) for mammals, and complement with PanTHERIA (Jones et al., 2009) and Phylacine (Faurby et al. 2018). After compiling the trait data, we pruned the trait data and phylogeny, however 786 amphibians species (~11%), 268 squamates (~3%), and 322 mammal species (~8%) were not present in the phylogenies and were excluded from the analyzes. Furthermore, 1400 amphibian (~21%) and 82 mammalian (~2%) species had no body size/body mass data available. Therefore, we imputed trait data for these species. We chose to use phylogenetic imputation methods that perform well for macroecological studies. In addition, our data have adequate assumptions because they consist of continuous variables (body mass and body size) and represent <25% of the database (Johnson et al., 2020).
Firstly, we fitted alternative evolutionary models (Brownian motion, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, and Early Burst) to body size/body mass using the geiger R package (Pennell 268 et al., 2014) for 5,053 species for amphibians and 3,771 species for mammals. The best fit model was Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) for both groups. After that, we used this model to conduct data imputation in the RPhyloPars package (Goolsby et al., 2017). Thus, our final dataset contained 6,453 amphibians, 9,487 squamates, 9,993 birds, and 3853 non-flying mammal species. Our final dataset corresponds to ~75% of amphibian richness (8646 species in Frost, 2023), ~82% of reptiles (11,549 species in Reptile DataBase, 2022), ~91% of birds (10,906 species in Birds of the World, 2023), and ~76% of mammals (5,084 excluding Chiroptera species in Upham et al., 2023) known to occur in the world. 

Rate of phenotypic evolution 
We further estimated rates of trait evolution using BAMM v.2.5.0 [35]. We chose BAMM to estimate trait evolution because it outperforms other methods [48]. Primeiro, usamos o pacote ‘BAMMtools’ R package to generate the control file, including priors and other parameters estimates [49]. For trait diversification analysis in BAMM, we set the rate shift prior to γ = 1 and sampled the models every 1000 generations for a total of 11 million generations using a burn-in of 1 million generations. The number of generations and burn-in used to estimate traits evolutionary rates varied and were chosen based on the visual inspection of the log-likelihood trace of the MCMC output and the effect sample sizes (greater than or equal to 200). 

Composition list
Similar to first chapter, using the letsR package (CIT) in R, we obtained our species list building a presence-absence matrices separately for each group of vertebrates by overlaying species occurrence polygons on a 10x10 km grid with 0.5º cells. we considered a species to be present in a cell if at least 50% of the species' polygon covered the cell. We utilized the consensus extent of the Atlantic Forest proposed by Muylaert et al. (2018) to determine species occurrence in domain. We obtained occurrence amphibian data from IUCN (2021) and complemented with shapefiles from Vasconcelos et al. (2019). Squamates data occurrence was sourced from Roll et al. (2017), while bird occurrence data from BirdLife (2015), and mammals from IUCN (2021). Our species pool comprised native and non-migrating species across the entire Atlantic Forest. In total, our presence-absence matrices included 518 frog species, 402 squamates, 815 birds, and 236 mammals.
        We pruned the species to which we had occurrence and trait data from the respective phylogenies using the R package picante (Kembel et al., 2010). Yet, 24 frog (~3%), 70 birds (~10%), and 28 mammals (~14%) species had not been sampled in the phylogenies and were removed from analysis.

Climatic niche
Para obtermos a posição de nicho climático das espécies e a largura de nicho, primeiro precisamos extrait for each grid cell, the mean of climatic variables.  Nós escolhemos variáveis climáticas que potencialmente afetam range limits in vertebrates (e.g., Wiens et al., 2006; Botero et al., 2014), and influence large-scale species distributions. Além disso, falar que pegamos variáveis climáticas do passado. The present climate data from CHELSA correspond to the average of their collection period, between the years 1981–2010. We firstly chose six bioclimatic variables from CHELSA dataset (Brun et al., 2022): Mean annual air temperature (BIO1), Temperature Seasonality (BIO4), Temperature Annual Range (BIO7), Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter (BIO11), Precipitation Seasonality (BIO15), and Precipitation of Driest Quarter (BIO17). After testing for multicollinearity, we excluded BIO1 and BIO11 that had Variation Inflation Factor >10 from further analysis. Após a seleção das variáveis climáticas, usamos o OMI para obtermos a posição do nicho climático das espécies, assim como o valor breadth niche. 
        Utilizamos o Outlying Mean Index (OMI) para extrair a posição do nicho climático de cada espécie e de cada grupo, a fim de obtermos um valor que represente o centro da range climático que uma espécie ocupa. Além disso, utilizamos o valor de Tol para representar a tolerância da espécie, que pode ser entendida como um proxy para amplitude do nicho climático que a espécie ocupa. Essas análises foram fundamentais para a decomposição do nicho climático realizado pelas espécies investigadas, permitindo-nos compreender melhor suas preferências climáticas e as possíveis interações com o ambiente.
