Abstract
Several factors contribute to determining phenotypic variation on macroevolutionary scales. These can be both biotic (Red Queen Hypothesis) and abiotic (Court Jester Hypothesis) factors, but not exclusive. In this context, lineages have traits that evolve and vary through the time and that can respond to variations according to the ecological niche they occupy. Therefore, the phenotypic rate evolution and its relationship with the ecological niche of the species can inform us about the evolutionary mechanisms that generate differences in the functional diversity between biological communities. For this reason, we use here data from ectothermic (frogs and squamates) and endothermic (birds and non-volant mammals) terrestrial vertebrates that occur in the Atlantic Forest, a climatically and historically complex biome, as a model to answer our questions about the patterns and climatic niche effects on the phenotypic rate evolution of these groups. We found that terrestrial vertebrates show idiosyncratic patterns of phenotypic evolution rate throuth the time. Furthermore, we found a high heterogeneity in evolution rates within each group that occurs in the Atlantic Forest, with lineages showing accelerations and other decelerations in evolutionary rates. Our results suggest that different selective pressures act on each group of terrestrial vertebrates, leading to unique patterns of changes in size and body mass over time. However, there is no statistically significant relationship between the rates of phenotypic evolution and the climatic niche occupied by the species, but the amplitude of the climatic niche had a greater influence on the variation of rates than the position of the niche on the rates of evolution. These findings underscore the importance of selective pressures and group-specific characteristics in phenotypic evolution.

Introduction
Several factors contribute to determine phenotypic variation on a macroevolutionary scales (Harmon, 2014). From the tradition of paleobiology, the influence of biotic factors on trait rates and lineage diversification has been called the "Red Queen Hypothesis" (Van Valen, 1973), while the influence of abiotic factors "Court Jester Hypothesis" (Barnosky, 1999). Much emphasis has been given to biotic interactions, such as competition (e.g. Drury et al., 2016), as being the main determinants of the divergence of ecologically relevant characters between species at micro and macroevolutionary scales (reviewed in Hembry and Weber, 2020). Likewise, other studies point out that the climatic niche can also influence the diversification and variation of traits (Lawson and Weir, 2014; Clavel and Morlon 2017, Luzuriaga-Aveiga and Weir 2019; Barreto et al., 2023a). The climatic niche is the set of climatic conditions to which populations of a species are subject throughout their geographic distribution (Budic and Dormann 2015). Usually, this measure is used to project the physiological tolerance limits of a species (Bozinovic et al., 2011) in the multidimensional climate space and to investigate its influence on the spatial distribution of species and range limits (Gaston, 2003). Interestingly, high rates of climatic niche evolution seem to promote speciation, as demonstrated for salamander lineages (Kozak and Wiens, 2010), Anolis lizards (Velasco et al., 2016), birds (Cooney et al., 2016 ; Barreto et al., 2023a), and Gentianaceae (Matuszak et al., 2016). Therefore, assuming that diversification rates of species are correlated with phenotypic rates evolution (see Rabosky and Adams, 2012, Rabosky et al., 2013, Barreto et al., 2023a), it is possible that the evolution of the climatic niche also has a strong influence on the phenotypic variation of species (Lawson and Weir, 2014).
The body size of a species is an trait often used to point out an ecological differentiation between species (Peters, 1986). In addition, it is also a proxy for other ecologically important variables, such as metabolic rates and susceptibility to dehydration, which may restrict the dispersal and colonization capacity of certain lineages (Rolland et al., 2018; Gouveia et al., 2019). Endotherms (birds and non-volant mammals), for example, have significantly lower rates of body temperature evolution than ectotherms (amphibians and squamates; Moreira et al., 2021). In this sense, endotherms and ectotherms are expected to have different thermal capacities and tolerances between them, triggering different evolutionary responses to climatic conditions (Rolland et al., 2018). According to Bergmann's ecogeographic rule, temperature selection is predicted to result in larger body sizes in colder climates, such as higher latitudes and elevations (e.g. Pincheira-Donoso, 2010). However, this evidence seems to be more supported in endotherms (Meiri, 2011; Olson et al., 2009; Pincheira-Donoso, 2010), while there are still divergences of the effect on ectotherms (Pincheira-Donoso & Meiri, 2013; Slavenko et al., 2019; Womack & Bell, 2020). In addition, there is also a relationship between the seasonality of rainfall in the body size of frogs, where frogs develop larger body sizes in climates where there is less precipitation (Johnson et al., 2023). Therefore, the response of a species' body size to its climatic niche (e.g. temperature, seasonality, precipitation) can result in morphological changes both along geological timescales (Barreto et al., 2023b) and on contemporary scales (Zheng et al., 2023). Furthermore, these changes can occur in populations and even in biological communities as a whole (Millien et al., 2006).
Lineages have characteristics that evolve and that can also vary over time (Harmon, 2014). Thus, the evolutionary rate a trait can be understood as the speed with which it evolves along the phylogeny, that is, its variance through the time. In this context, the evolutionary phenotypic rate and its relationship with the ecological niche of species can inform us about the evolutionary mechanisms that generate differences in functional diversity between communities. In general, these issues have been evaluated on a global scale or using specific lineages (e.g. Luzuriaga-Aveiga and Weir 2019; Huang et al., 2022; Barreto et al., 2023), while little is known about how the climatic niche can influence the phenotypic evolution rates of different communities in the same geographic template. For example, there is a marked difference between the North Atlantic Forest (historically warmer and more stable) and the South (colder and more unstable; Carnaval et al. 2014), which may contribute to selecting species with more life history traits adapted to each region. For example, ecological gradients seem to be involved in the speciation of Rhinella crucifer frogs in the Atlantic Forest (Thomé et al. 2010) and in the intraspecific divergence of birds and mammals on a global scale (Botero et al., 2014). Likewise, the ecological differentiation of Neotropical birds may accelerate trait evolution, but does not seem to affect species diversification (Luzuriaga-Aveiga and Weir, 2019). Specifically, elevation difference is associated with faster divergence in bird calls, as well as morphological traits that contribute to reproductive isolation (Luzuriaga-Aveiga and Weir, 2019). However, no study has yet analyzed how the climatic niche of vertebrates with distinct dispersal abilities and thermal tolerance affects the evolution of ecologically relevant traits such as body size.
For this reason, herein we use the data of terrestrial vertebrates (amphibians, squamates, birds and non-volant mammals) that occur in the Atlantic Forest, a climatically and historically complex biome, as a model to answer our questions about the patterns and effects of the climatic niche on the phenotypic rate evolution of these groups. We address the following questions: 1) Is there a similar pattern in the evolutionary trajectories of ectotherms and endotherms? 2) Does the climatic niche of a species dictate the speed of the rate of phenotypic evolution? We expect that climate gradients over space and time are important in differentiating the body size evolution of endotherms and ectotherms. In this context, we expect to find more similar evolutionary trends among ectotherms, when compared to endotherms, since physiological restrictions can be important evolutionary drivers in these animals (Rolland et al., 2018; Gouveia et al., 2019). Furthermore, I expect to find an influence of the climatic niche on the rate of phenotypic evolution in the four groups of vertebrates, but this effect should be even greater in ectotherms.

Materials and methods
Phylogeny
The MCCT  topology  of Jetz & Pyron (2018), which includes 7,239 amphibian species, was used for frogs. The fully-sampled consensus tree by Tonini et al. (2016), encompassing 9,754 squamate species. For mammals, we utilized the fully-sampled tree provided by Upham et al. (2019) with 4,175 species. For birds, since a consensus tree was not available, we followed the approach of Rubolini et al. (2015) and generated 10,000 posterior trees for the 9,993 bird species using the 'Hackett' backbone proposed by Jetz et al. (2012). Subsequently, we constructed a maximum clade credibility tree (MCCT) using the DendroPy (Sukumaran and Holder, 2010) and SumTrees (Sukumaran and Holder, 2015) packages in Python 3.9.13 (Van Rossum and Drake, 2009).
        
Trait data
We obtained data on body size for frogs, and body mass for squamates, birds, and mammals for all species included in the respective phylogenies above from the following sources: i) amphiBIO (Oliveira et al., 2017) and Vasconcelos et al. (2019) for frogs; ii) Guedes et al. (2023) for squamates; iii) AVONET (Tobias et al., 2022) for birds; and iv) Elton Traits (Wilman et al., 2014) for mammals, complemented with PanTHERIA (Jones et al., 2009) and Phylacine (Faurby et al. 2018). Afterwards, we pruned the respective phylogenies using the R package picante (Kembel et al., 2010) to only include species to which we have trait data. However, 786 amphibians species (~11%), 268 squamates (~3%), and 322 mammal species (~8%) with body size data available were not sampled  in the phylogenies and were excluded from further analyzes. Furthermore, 1,400 amphibian (~21%) and 82 mammalian (~2%) species had no body size/body mass data available. Therefore, we imputed trait data for these species. 
We used phylogenetic imputation methods that perform well for macroecological studies. In addition, our data have adequate assumptions because they consist of continuous variables (body mass and body size) and represent <25% of the database (Johnson et al., 2021). Firstly, we fitted alternative evolutionary models (Brownian motion, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, and Early Burst) to body size/body mass using the geiger R package (Pennell et al., 2014) for 5,053 species for amphibians and 3,771 species for mammals. The best fit model was Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) for both groups. After that, we used this model to conduct data imputation in the RPhyloPars package (Goolsby et al., 2017). For birds and squamates, this procedure was not necessary, as all species that have available body mass data were present in the respective trees. Thus, our final dataset contained 6,453 amphibians, 9,487 squamates, 9,993 birds, and 3853 non-flying mammal species. Our final dataset corresponds to ~75% of amphibian richness (8,646 species in Frost, 2023), ~82% of reptiles (11,549 species in Reptile DataBase, 2021), ~91% of birds (10,906 species in Billerman et al., 2022), and ~76% of mammals (5,084 species, excluding Chiroptera  in Upham et al., 2023) known to occur in the world. 

Rate of phenotypic evolution 
        To estimate the rate evolution of body size (Frogs) and body mass (Squamates, mammals and birds) of vertebrates occurring in the Atlantic Forest, we used a two-step procedure: first, we used trait data for all species sampled in the most comprehensive tree available in the literature for each group, and then we retrieved the rate estimated only for the species occurring the Atlantic Forest from these global trees. We adopted this approach because the Atlantic Forest species pool did not evolve independently of other sister species that may occur in other biogeographical formations (Drury et al., 2016; Drury et al., 2018; Drury et al., 2021).In addition, through simulation work, it was found that larger (≥ 450 points) and more complete (≥ 60%) phylogenetic trees are more suitable for analysis of diversification rates (Mynard et al., 2023). 
We estimated rates of phenotypic evolution using BAMM v.2.5.0 (Bayesian analysis of macroevolutionary mixture; Rabosky et al., 2014). BAMM has some  advantages in comparison with other methods (e.g. Cooney and Thomas, 2021; Barreto et al., 2023). For example, it allows the modeling of evolutionary rates over time and between clades, detecting the heterogeneity. Furthermore, it is able to detect evolutionary  innovations, rate shifts, and diversity dependency in phylogenetic trees. In addition, it is computationally efficient, allowing us to deal with large sets of phylogenetic data. Firstly, we used the 'BAMMtools' R package (Rabosky et al., 2014) to create  a batch file, including priors and other parameter estimates for each group separately . e set the rate of change before γ = 1 and sampled models every 1,000 generations for a total of 12 million generations for amphibians and birds, 45 million generations for squamates, and 10 million generations for mammals. We used a burn-in of 25% of generations for all groups. The number of generations and burn-in used to estimate the evolutionary rates of the traits varied and were chosen based on visual inspection of the log-likelihood of the MCMC output and the effective sample sizes (> 200). Afterwards, we extracted the rates from the posterior distribution to obtain the phenotypic rate for each species using the getTipRates function and plotRateThroughTime function to visualize the rate of evolution through the time.

Species composition of the study extent 
Similarly to the first chapter, using the letsR package (Vilela and Villalobos, 2015) in R, we obtained  presence-absence matrices separately for each group of vertebrates by overlaying polygons on a 10x10 Km grid with 0.5º cells, totaling 432 communities (or cell grids). We considered a species to be present in a cell if at least 50% of the species' polygon covered the cell. We used the consensus extent of the Atlantic Forest proposed by Muylaert et al. (2018) to determine species occurrence in the domain. We obtained extent-of-occurrence data for amphibians from IUCN (2021) and complemented it with shapefiles from Vasconcelos et al. (2019). Occurrence data for squamates was sourced from Roll et al. (2017), while bird occurrence data was extracted from BirdLife (2015), and mammals from IUCN (2021). Our species pool comprised native and non-migrating species across the entire Atlantic Forest. In total, our presence-absence matrices included 518 frog species, 402 squamates, 815 birds, and 236 mammals.
        Finally, we extracted  the rates of phenotipic evolution for each species estimated with  BAMM for the species present in those presence-absence matrices. However, 54 species of frogs (~10%), 34 species of squamates (~9%), 120 birds (~15%), and 42 mammals (~14%) were not sampled in their respectives phylogenies and are not included in further analysis. Our final dataset corresponds to ~89% of amphibian richness (707 species), ~91% of squamates (492 species), ~68% of birds (1,025 species), and ~74% of mammals (262 species) known to occur in the Atlantic Forest (Figueiredo et al., 2021). 

Climatic niche
We used PALEO-PGEM-Series, a global dataset that provides spatio-temporal (1° × 1°) information on climate variables dating to 5 Myr, to extract  bioclimatic variables at a 1 kyr resolution (Barreto et al., 2023b). This dataset offers detailed climate data and is derived from emulations performed with an atmosphere-ocean general circulation model. In our study, we focused only on data from the past 5 Myr (Plio-Pleistocene). By incorporating this database, we can assess the climatic niche of species using the oldest available climatic variables in the literature (Barreto et al., 2023b). This enables us to investigate the relationship between species evolution and past climate conditions, contributing to a better understanding of the connections between biodiversity and climate. This is particularly valuable for studying the macroevolutionary processes of species, as these processes occur over extended periods of time. For comparative purposes, we also used the present climate data from CHELSA (0.5° × 0.5°; Brun et al., 2022), which corresponds to the mean between 1981–2010. In order to obtain the climatic variables for the study geographical extent, we used the raster package (Hijmans et al, 2015) in R and extracted the bioclimatic mean for each grid cell.
Factors such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, and seasonality can directly affect morphological, physiological, and behavioral aspects of organisms (Luzuriaga-Aveiga and Weir, 2019; Drury et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022; Barreto et al., 2023). Thus, variations in climatic variables throughout space can influence trait evolution, such as body size and growth rate (e.g. Huang et al., 2022). For this reason, we have chosen six bioclimatic variables that potentially impact the rates of trait evolution in vertebrates. Furthermore, we chose the six bioclimatic variables that were present in both datasets: Mean annual air temperature (BIO1), Temperature Seasonality (BIO4), Temperature Annual Range (BIO7), Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter (BIO11), Precipitation Seasonality (BIO15), and Precipitation of Driest Quarter (BIO17). Afterwards, we extracted the mean of each climate variable for the grid used to make the composition matrix. To identify and handle potential multicollinearity between variables, we calculated the Variation Inflation Factor (VIF) in the usdm R package (Naimi, 2014) . Variables whose VIF  values > 3 were excluded from further analysis. Specifically, we excluded BIO04, BIO07, and BIO11 from the past data (PALEO-PGEM-Series) and BIO01 and BIO11 from present data (CHELSA). 
With the selected climate data, we calculated the climatic niche mean and breath for the past and present. We represented the breadth and position of the species' climatic niche using the Outlying Mean Index (OMI). The OMI analysis is a constrained ordination technique specifically developed to model linear and nonlinear species-environment relationships and it is useful to build multidimensional climatic volumes  (Dolédec et al., 2000). Thus, it is possible to obtain insights into the tolerance (Tol) and the centrality (OMI) of the species' niche, distinguishing between generalist taxa that tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions and specialist ones that are limited to specific climatic conditions. Analysis was conducted  in the ade4 package (Dray and Dufour, 2007) in the R software. As climatic variables have different measurement units, the 'scale' and 'center' arguments of the ‘dudi.pca’ function were set to 'True' to standardize the scale (Legendre and Galagher, 2001). 



Statistical analysis
To test the influence of the species' climatic niche on the rate of phenotypic evolution (rate_phenotipic_evolution ~ OMI_present + OMI_past + Tol_present + Tol_past), we used   Phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares (PGLS) models for each group separately. This analysis consists of Generalized Linear Models (GLS) that incorporate a covariance matrix describing the phylogenetic relationships between the studied species. Specifically, we fitted the model using REML, while also estimating Pagel’s lambda parameter to control for phylogenetic autocorrelation in the residuals (Revell, 2010). Analysis was conducted in the nlme R package (Pinheiro et al., 2017). We calculated the coefficients of determination (R2) using the rr2 package in R (Ives and Li, 2018). (Figure 1). Diagnostics was conducted by visually inspecting the fitted vs. residual plot (Figure S1). Residuals of all models had homogeneity of variance.

Results
The world's terrestrial vertebrates exhibit idiosyncratic patterns in their respective evolutionary rates of  body size and body mass through time (Figure 2). The rate through time plot of amphibians shows a peak from 200 Myr then the rate is practically stationary onwards. There is also a small drop from 50 Myr onwards. In squamates, evolutionary rates are more stationary over time when compared to other groups. There is only a small increase before 50 Myr and another exponential increase more recently. In birds, there are  two peaks: the first one close to 80 Myr, and another soon after 50 Myr. After these peaks, the rate of evolution of bird body mass shows a declining trend. In mammals, there is a declining  trend in the rate through time.
We found high heterogeneity in the evolutionary rates within each group occurring in the Atlantic Forest (Figure 3). In amphibians, most species had higher rates. However, the highest rates were  in Bokermannohyla treefrogs (Hylidae) and in Leptodactylus frogs (Leptodactylidae). In Bufonidae, those of the genus Dendrophryniscus and Melanophryniscus had lower rates, while Rhinella had higher rates. Likewise, brachycephalid frogs had lower rates of body size evolution. In squamates, rates differed between lizards, amphisbaenians, and snakes. Lizards had  the lowest rates of body mass compared to other groups. Amphisbaenians on the other hand had high rates. In snakes, this pattern is more distributed, with Dipsas snakes (Dipsadinae) and Liotyphlops (Anomalepididae) with lower rates, and Boidae and Pseudoboinae with higher rates. In birds, rates were concentrated in only a few lineages, such as Tinamiformes, Galliformes, and Accipitriformes, with the highest ones in ducks, geese, and other waterfowl species. Other lineages, such as hummingbirds, generally had lower evolutionary rates for body mass. In mammals, there were more species with intermediate evolutionary rates. However, primates in general had lower rates, as well as the Tayassuidae wild pigs and tapir (Tapirus terrestris). Conversely, the highest evolutionary rates were in Felidae, Cryptonanus opossums, and some lineage-specific species.
We found more restricted climatic niche spaces in ectotherms when compared to endotherms (Figure 4). However, we found no significant relationship between species niche position or niche breadth on evolutionary rate of body size/mass in the species pool  from the Atlantic Forest (Figure 5). Furthermore, niche breadth had a greater influence on evolutionary rate than niche position. The confidence interval overlaps positive and negative values, indicating that there is a high variation in rates across all vertebrate groups, but lower in amphibians. Still, there is a marked difference between amphibians and other vertebrates. While  the niche breath for present climate data of amphibians negatively influenced the evolutionary rate, for the other groups it was the opposite. We also found opposite effects when comparing past and present climate data. There was a positive effect of present niche breadth on evolutionary rate, but  a negative effect of past climate. In addition, past climate data showed negative coefficients in all groups, with the exception of niche position (OMI) in amphibians. This means that the effect of evolutionary rate depends on the time scale of the data and can affect the conclusions of how climate impacts on phenotypic rate evolution. 

Discussion
Herein, we assess the temporal trends of the phenotypic rate evolution for terrestrial vertebrates and find distinct patterns among them. Still, we did not observe a marked difference between ectotherms and endotherms. These idiosyncratic patterns may indicate that different adaptation patterns are operating in each group. Likewise, it is possible to notice the same idiocratic pattern in the Atlantic Forest species pool. For example, in amphibians there is a deceleration of the evolutionary rate in small species (e.g. Dendrophryniscus spp., Brachycephalidae) while in mammals there is a deceleration in larger species (e.g. Primates and Tapirus terrestris). In birds, higher evolutionary rates occurred in larger species, such as raptors and species that occupy terrestrial and aquatic habitats (e.g. Tinamiformes, Galliformes). In squamates, there is a marked difference between lizards (lower rates) and amphisbaenians (higher rates). On the other hand, in snakes there is greater heterogeneity in rates, with lineages that show acceleration (e.g. Boidae) and others with deceleration, as observed in snakes from the Typhlopoidea tribe (e.g., Trilepida spp. and Liotyphlops spp.). This suggests that each group may have experienced distinct selective pressures according to their ecological traits, resulting in unique patterns of changes in size and body mass through the time (e.g. Luzuriaga-Aveiga and Weir, 2019; Drury et al., 2021). In addition, we tested whether the phenotypic rate evolution of Atlantic Forest vertebrates are impacted by the climatic niche. We found no statistically significant relationship, however the breadth of the climatic niche is more important than niche position to explain variations in evolutionary rates. Our findings begin to unravel the importance of climate and evolutionary processes on the phenotypic rate evolution in vertebrates, especially for understanding the complex evolutionary history of the Atlantic Forest and its high biodiversity.
        Contrary to our expectation, there is no marked difference between the temporal trends of endotherms and ectotherms. Furthermore, we found that the world's terrestrial vertebrates exhibit idiosyncratic patterns in their respective phenotypic evolutionary trajectories. Therefore, it is possible that terrestrial vertebrates are subject to different selective pressures that act differently in each group (e.g. Moreira et al., 2021; Johnson et al., 2023). For example, an increase in the diversification rate is recognized in birds from about 50 Myr ago to the near present (Jetz et al., 2012). On the other hand, when we evaluate the mass evolution rates over time for birds, it is possible to observe the beginning of the rate deceleration at approximately the same period (~50 Myr). Although our results do not allow clarifying the mechanisms and processes that influenced this pattern, a prominent decline in the body mass of modern birds is recognized in several taxa (Kiat et al., 2021), which may be related to selection forces related to the performance of flight (Dececchi and Larsson, 2013; Puttick et al., 2014). In the same way, physiological restrictions influence the body size of amphibians and differently between orders. Caecilians have larger body sizes in arid areas, while anurans are more subject to seasonality of precipitation and temperature (Johnson et al., 2023). In this sense, it is expected that fluctuations in the phenotypic rate evolution are related to the exploration of new adaptive zones for each group (e.g. Barreto et al., 2023). In this context, biotic (Hembry and Weber 2020) and abiotic (Lawson and Weir, 2014; Clavel and Morlon, 2017; Luzuriaga-Aveiga and Weir, 2019) pressures over time act in different ways in each group of vertebrate. Thus, they select optimal phenotype sizes, where fitness is maximized due to different selection pressures (Johnson et al., 2023). Therefore, it is expected that the result of the phenotypic evolution is a balance between the demands of different selective pressures in different groups and that it is strongly influenced by life history.
        We found a high heterogeneity in evolutionary rates within each group of Atlantic Forest vertebrates, with some lineages showing accelerations in the phenotypic rate evolution and others a deceleration. We found a pattern of high evolutionary rates in lineages of water and land birds, such as ducks, geese and chickens. In snakes, we found higher rates in large species, such as those from the Boidae family, and decelerations in rates in snakes from the Typhlopoidea tribe that have fossorial habits and are one of the smallest species in the regional pool (Marques et al., 2019). Another example we found occurs in the Bufonidae frogs family. The bromeliad-toads Dendrophryniscus species. are species of smaller body size that inhabit bromeliads (Haddad et al., 2013), with low evolutionary rates of body size. While, the cane-toad (Rhinella spp.) is a larger species, with terrestrial habits and that presented high evolutionary rates of body size. The variation in rates in these species could be associated with specific adaptations to the spaces of the ecological niche that these species occupy (Luzuriaga-Aveiga and Weir, 2019; Drury et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022). For example, it is known that the ecological differentiation of Neotropical birds can accelerate the evolution of ecologically important traits for sexual selection, such as singing (Luzuriaga-Aveiga and Weir, 2019). Likewise, it is known that the evolution of mammalian body mass has been strongly influenced by habitat transitions, with only an indirect effect of past climate changes (Huang et al., 2022). Thus, it is possible that the presence of lower evolutionary rates in certain groups indicates specialized adaptations and a certain stability in their ecological niches. Therefore, the rates may be related to the diversity and occupation of particular ecological niches of each lineage (Simpson, 1953; Jetz et al., 2012; Drury et al., 2021). New efforts will be directed to include other axes of the ecological niche of species in an attempt to elucidate the processes that direct the evolutionary rates of body size in vertebrates[a]. 
        We found that the climatic niche occupied by a species does not dictate the evolution of phenotypic evolutionary rates. We also found a difference in the coefficients whether we used past or present climate data, which may influence the interpretation of the results. In addition, endotherms have a greater number of species that occupy more generalist climatic niches when compared to ectotherms. This may be related to greater thermal tolerance in these groups and a greater dispersion capacity when compared to ectotherms (Buckley et al., 2012; Rolland et al., 2018). The lack of a significant relationship between species position and niche width with phenotypic evolutionary rates may indicate that other factors, such as different ecological niche axes (Drury et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2022) and/or restrictions of each clade (Drury et al., 2021; Acevedo et al., 2022), may play a more important role in shaping the patterns observed for terrestrial vertebrates of the Atlantic Forest. However, there is a greater influence of the niche breadth of the species on the evolutionary rate, when compared with the niche position that the species occupies. This suggests that species tolerance has a greater influence on variation in evolutionary rates in vertebrates. A possible explanation for this pattern is that species with broader climatic niches may experience greater ecological opportunities and experience more selection pressures (e.g. Rolland et al., 2018; Acevedo et al., 2022). Thus, leading to greater variation in evolutionary responses in phenotypic traits. An example of this is that in terrestrial vertebrates, changes in the climatic niche occur faster in endotherms than in ectotherms (Rolland et al., 2018), which allows these animals to exploit a wider range of resources and habitats, which can lead to to greater phenotypic variation and adaptive responses. On the other hand, species with narrower niches may have already reached a high level of specialization and adaptation to their specific ecological niche (Barreto et al., 2023a). As a result, they may experience lower rates of evolutionary change in phenotypic traits because they are already adapted to their environment and face less selective pressure for further body size/mass modifications. Furthermore, these responses may vary within each vertebrate group and spatially (e.g. Drury et al., 2021). More studies are needed to unravel the macroevolutionary patterns of terrestrial vertebrates, especially in historically complex environments such as the Atlantic Forest.
        Herein, we add an initial understanding of the evolutionary patterns of phenotypic evolution in vertebrates. In general, vertebrates showed distinct evolutionary trends of phenotypic traits, probably associated with specializations in their respective life histories. Furthermore, we did not find a relationship between the position and width of the climatic niche of the species and their respective phenotypic evolutionary rates. It is possible that other axes of the ecological niche of the species, such as the spatial niche related to the habitat and/or the trophic niche, act more strongly on the evolutionary rates related to the phenotypic traits of vertebrates. These findings have implications for our understanding of the drivers of evolutionary change in phenotypic rates and the factors that shape biodiversity patterns at regional scales. Still, future studies should be directed towards verifying the evolutionary trends within orders and in the main families of vertebrates, in an attempt to unravel the macroevolutionary patterns of size and body mass in terrestrial vertebrates.

Figure 1. Schematic model of the methodology used. First, we chose the most comprehensive species tree known for each terrestrial vertebrate group, as well as using the respective broader databases with amphibian body size, and body mass of squamates, birds and mammals. After that, we estimate the evolutionary rates for each group using BAMM (Bayesian analysis of macroevolutionary mixture; Rabosky, 2014) and then extract these rates for each species to obtain the phenotypic evolutionary rate. To access the climatic niche of each species, we consulted two temporal-spatially explicit climate databases (Present in CHELSA database in Brun et al., 2022 and past PALEO-PGEM-Series in Barreto et al., 2023). We extract the mean of each climate variable for the grid used to make the species composition matrix of vertebrates in Atlantic Forest. After that, we extract niche indices for past and present data. We chose to represent the breadth and position of the species' climatic niche using the Outlying Mean Index (OMI). Finally, to test the influence of the species' climatic niche on the rate of phenotypic evolution (rate_phenotipic_evolution ~ OMI_present + OMI_past + Tol_present + Tol_past), we employed a Phylogenetic Analysis of Generalized Least Squares (PGLS). 
  

Figure 2. Rate evolution of body size (amphibians) and body mass (squamates, birds and mammals) through-time trajectories for terrestrial vertebrates. Trait rate indicates the evolution rates of body size/body mass for the broader tree known, indicating the trend of adaptive radiation of vertebrates in the world. The blue density shading illustrates the relative probability of a rate at any point in time and the red line indicates the evolutionary trajectory of body size/body mass.
  

Figure 3. Evolution dynamics of body size and body mass of terrestrial vertebrates that occur in the Atlantic Forest domain. Warmer colors (yellow) denote faster rates of trait evolution, cold colors (blue) indicate slower rates.  In general, it is possible to note that the faster evolutionary rates are more concentrated and distributed among the ectotherm lineages when compared to the endotherms. Trees with tip labels are available in supplementary material.

Figure 4. Climatic niche mean (OMI and OMI past) and breath (Tol and Tol past) for the past and present data. Lower values (lighter tones) indicate more specialized taxa, in which case they are limited to specific climatic conditions. Higher values (reddish tones) indicate generalist taxa, those that tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions.

Figure 5. Phylogenetic Analysis of Generalized Least Squares (PGLS) of each group of vertebrates from the Atlantic Forest and the respective coefficients (black dots) and confidence intervals (dashed line). OMI represents the position of the climatic niche in the present (OMI present) and in the past (OMI past), that is, the centrality of the climatic space in which the species occurs. Likewise, the climatic niche breadth is represented in the present (Tolerance present) and in the past (Tolerance past). Although no relationship tested was significant (P > 0.05), it is possible to observe that the climatic niche breadth has a greater effect in all groups of vertebrates when compared to the niche position.

Não sei também se valeria a pena fazer um só com o pool da Mata Atlântica para comparar, ou até como um "teste" de sensibilidade, não sei, não achei muitas referências que falam sobre essa diferença de estimar taxas para pool regional/pool mundial, geralmente os trabalhos focam em um clado da arvore. Podemos pensar melhor nisso
