Introduction
O tamanho do corpo de um organismo é um importante traço funcional para garantir a sobrevivência da espécie. 

Materials and methods
Phylogeny
To extract the rate of evolution of body size (Frogs) and body mass (Squamates, mammals and birds) of vertebrates, we used the most comprehensive tree available in the literature for each group. We adopted this approach because the Atlantic Forest species pool did not evolve independently of other sister species that may occur in other biogeographical formations. For this reason, excluding and selecting only the pool of target species could impact evolution estimates, so we use the phylogeny with the most comprehensive trees as possible to infer evolutionary rates.
We utilized four trees for each taxonomic group in our study. The consensus tree by Jetz & Pyron (2018), which includes 7,239 amphibian species. The fully-sampled consensus tree by Tonini et al. (2016), encompassing 9,754 squamate species. For mammals, we utilized the fully-sampled tree provided by Upham et al. (2019) with 4175 species. In the case of birds, since a consensus tree was not available, we followed the approach of Rubolini et al. (2015) and generated 10,000 posterior trees for the 9,993 bird species using the 'Hackett' backbone proposed by Jetz et al. (2012). Subsequently, we constructed a maximum clade credibility topology (MCCT) using the DendroPy and SumTrees (Sukumaran and Holder, 2010) packages using Python.

Trait data
We obtained data on body size for amphibia, and body mass for squamates, birds and mammals from the following sources: i) amphiBIO (Oliveira et al., 2017) and Vasconcelos et al. (2019) for frogs; ii) Guedes et al. (2023) for squamates; iii) AVONET (Tobias et al., 2022) for birds; and iv) Elton Traits (Wilman et al., 2014) for mammals, and complement with PanTHERIA (Jones et al., 2009) and Phylacine (Faurby et al. 2018). After compiling the trait data, we pruned the trait data and phylogeny using the package Picante (Kembel et al., 2010). However, 786 amphibians species (~11%), 268 squamates (~3%), and 322 mammal species (~8%) were not present in the phylogenies and were excluded from the analyzes. Furthermore, 1400 amphibian (~21%) and 82 mammalian (~2%) species had no body size/body mass data available. Therefore, we imputed trait data for these species. We chose to use phylogenetic imputation methods that perform well for macroecological studies. In addition, our data have adequate assumptions because they consist of continuous variables (body mass and body size) and represent <25% of the database (Johnson et al., 2020).
Firstly, we fitted alternative evolutionary models (Brownian motion, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, and Early Burst) to body size/body mass using the geiger R package (Pennell 268 et al., 2014) for 5,053 species for amphibians and 3,771 species for mammals. The best fit model was Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) for both groups. After that, we used this model to conduct data imputation in the RPhyloPars package (Goolsby et al., 2017). Thus, our final dataset contained 6,453 amphibians, 9,487 squamates, 9,993 birds, and 3853 non-flying mammal species. Our final dataset corresponds to ~75% of amphibian richness (8646 species in Frost, 2023), ~82% of reptiles (11,549 species in Reptile DataBase, 2022), ~91% of birds (10,906 species in Birds of the World, 2023), and ~76% of mammals (5,084 excluding Chiroptera species in Upham et al., 2023) known to occur in the world. 

Rate of phenotypic evolution 
        We further estimated rates of phenotypic evolution using the software BAMM v.2.5.0 (Bayesian analysis of macroevolutionary mixture; Rabosky, 2014). BAMM was selected due to its advantages in comparison with other methods (e.g. Cooney and Thomas, 2021; Barreto et al., 2023). For example, BAMM allows the modeling of evolutionary rates over time and between clades, detecting the heterogeneity of these rates. Furthermore, it is able to detect important innovations, rate changes and diversity dependence in phylogenetic trees. In addition, it is computationally efficient, allowing it to deal with large sets of phylogenetic data . Firstly, we use the 'BAMMtools' R package to generate the control file, including priors and other parameter estimates for each group (Rabosky et al., 2014). For rate trait diversification analysis in BAMM, we set the rate of change before γ = 1 and sampled the models every 1000 generations for a total of 12 million generations for amphibians and birds, 45 million generations for squamates and 10 million generations for mammals. All groups used a burn-in of 25% of generations. The number of generations and burn-in used to estimate the evolutionary rates of the traits varied and were chosen based on visual inspection of the log-likelihood trait of the MCMC output and the effect sample sizes (greater than or equal to 200). After this process, we extract the rates from the posterior distribution to obtain the values of the phenotypic rate evolution for each species.

Composition list
Similar to first chapter, using the letsR package (Vilela and Villalobos, 2015) in R, we obtained our species list building a presence-absence matrices separately for each group of vertebrates by overlaying species occurrence polygons on a 10x10 km grid with 0.5º cells. we considered a species to be present in a cell if at least 50% of the species' polygon covered the cell. We utilized the consensus extent of the Atlantic Forest proposed by Muylaert et al. (2018) to determine species occurrence in domain. We obtained occurrence amphibian data from IUCN (2021) and complemented with shapefiles from Vasconcelos et al. (2019). Squamates data occurrence was sourced from Roll et al. (2017), while bird occurrence data from BirdLife (2015), and mammals from IUCN (2021). Our species pool comprised native and non-migrating species across the entire Atlantic Forest. In total, our presence-absence matrices included 518 frog species, 402 squamates, 815 birds, and 236 mammals.
        Finally, we merged our species list with the rates of phenotipic evolution for each species calculated in the BAMM. However, 54 species of frogs (~10%), 34 species of squamates (~9%), 120 birds (~15%) and 42 mammals (~14%) were not sampled in respectives phylogenies and for this reason are not included in our analysis. Our final dataset corresponds to ~89% of amphibian richness (707 species), ~91% of reptiles (492 species), ~68% of birds (1025 species), and ~74% of mammals (262 species) known to occur in the Atlantic Forest (Figueiredo et al., 2021).

Climatic niche
Nós escolhemos variáveis climáticas que potencialmente afetam range limits in vertebrates (e.g., Wiens et al., 2006; Botero et al., 2014), and influence large-scale species distributions. Além disso, falar que pegamos variáveis climáticas do passado. The present climate data from CHELSA correspond to the average of their collection period, between the years 1981–2010. We firstly chose six bioclimatic variables from CHELSA dataset (Brun et al., 2022): Mean annual air temperature (BIO1), Temperature Seasonality (BIO4), Temperature Annual Range (BIO7), Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter (BIO11), Precipitation Seasonality (BIO15), and Precipitation of Driest Quarter (BIO17). After testing for multicollinearity, we excluded BIO1 and BIO11 that had Variation Inflation Factor >10 from further analysis. Após a seleção das variáveis climáticas, usamos o OMI para obtermos a posição do nicho climático das espécies, assim como o valor breadth niche. 
        Utilizamos o Outlying Mean Index (OMI) para extrair a posição do nicho climático de cada espécie e de cada grupo, a fim de obtermos um valor que represente o centro da range climático que uma espécie ocupa. Além disso, utilizamos o valor de Tol para representar a tolerância da espécie, que pode ser entendida como um proxy para amplitude do nicho climático que a espécie ocupa. Essas análises foram fundamentais para a decomposição do nicho climático realizado pelas espécies investigadas, permitindo-nos compreender melhor suas preferências climáticas e as possíveis interações com o ambiente.
