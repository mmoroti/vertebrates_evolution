Introduction
Diversos fatores contribuem para determinar a variação fenotípica em escala macroevolutiva. Muita ênfase tem sido dada às interações bióticas, tais como competição, como sendo as principais determinantes da divergência de caracteres ecologicamente relevantes entre espécies (Schluter, 2000, Harmon et al., 2010). No entanto, poucos estudos investigaram como a evolução de nicho climático pode influenciar a variação de atributos (mas veja Lawson e Weir, 2014, Luzuriaga-Aveiga & Weir 2019). O nicho climático é o conjunto de condições climáticas que populações de uma espécie estão sujeitas ao longo da sua distribuição geográfica (Budic & Dormann 2015). Usualmente, esta medida é usada para projetar os limites fisiológicos de tolerância de uma espécie (Bozinovic et al., 2011) no espaço climático multidimensional para investigar sua influência na distribuição espacial de espécies e limites de range (Gaston, 2003). De maneira interessante, altas taxas de evolução de nicho climático parecem promover especiação, como demonstrado para linhagens de salamandra (Kozak e Wiens, 2010), lagartos do gênero Anolis (Velasco et al., 2016), aves (Cooney et al., 2016), e Gentianaceae (Matuszak et al., 2016). Portanto, assumindo que as taxas de diversificação de espécies são correlacionadas com as taxas de evolução fenotípica (veja Rabosky e Adams, 2012, Rabosky et al., 2013), é possível que a evolução do nicho climático também tenha forte influência na variação fenotípica de espécies em larga escala espacial (Lawson e Weir, 2014). 
Enquanto essas questões têm sido avaliadas em escala global ou utilizando linhagens específicas, pouco se sabe como condições ambientais (e.g., sazonalidade de temperatura e precipitação) podem ter moldado o nicho climático de linhagens que ocorrem em biomas climaticamente complexos e influenciado taxas de evolução de atributos ecologicamente relevantes (e.g., tamanho de corpo e tamanho da prole). Tamanho de corpo é um atributo frequentemente usado para descrever diferenciação ecológica entre espécies (Peters, 1986), além de ser um substituto (proxy) para outras variáveis ecologicamente importantes. O tamanho da prole fornece uma medida do potencial reprodutivo (reproductive output) de uma espécie, que por sua vez é influenciada por fatores bióticos e abióticos, e fornece informações sobre estratégias reprodutivas utilizadas por espécies em diferentes ambientes (Giesel, 1976; Schluter 2000).
A taxa de evolução de um atributo é a velocidade com que ele evolui ao longo da filogenia. A relação entre o nicho climático e a taxa de evolução fenotípica pode informar sobre mecanismos evolutivos que geram diferenças na diversidade funcional entre comunidades distribuídas ao longo de7 gradientes de severidade climática da FA. Por exemplo, gradientes ecológicos parecem estar envolvidos na especiação de sapos do grupo de Rhinella crucifer na FA (Thomé et al. 2010) e na divergência intraespecífica de aves e mamíferos em escala global (Botero et al., 2014). Da mesma forma, a diferenciação ecológica de aves neotropicais pode acelerar a evolução de atributos mas parece não afetar a diversificação de espécies (Luzuriaga-Aveiga e Weir, 2019). Especificamente, a diferença de elevação está associada a uma divergência mais rápida nos cantos das aves, assim como de características morfológicas que contribuem para o isolamento reprodutivo (Luzuriaga-Aveiga e Weir, 2019). No entanto, nenhum estudo analisou como o nicho climático de vertebrados com capacidades de dispersão e tolerância térmica distintas afeta a evolução de atributos ecologicamente relevantes.
Espero que gradientes de sazonalidade de temperatura e pluviosidade sejam importantes para diferenciar o nicho climático das espécies. Ainda, espero que o nicho influencie a taxa de evolução de atributos ecologicamente relevantes (e.g., tamanho de corpo) diferentemente nos quatro grupos de vertebrados, devido às diferentes tolerâncias térmicas. Este efeito deve ser mais acentuado para ectotérmicos (anfíbios e squamata) do que endotermos (aves e mamíferos). Além disso, existe uma diferença marcante entre FA do Norte (mais quente e estável historicamente) e a do Sul (mais fria e instável; Carnaval et al. 2014), que pode contribuir para selecionar espécies com atributos de história de vida mais adaptados a cada região.
1. Temperature: Variation in temperature can influence metabolic rates, growth rates, and reproductive strategies of vertebrates, ultimately affecting their phenotypic evolution.
2. Precipitation: The availability of water resources, influenced by precipitation patterns, can impact the distribution, abundance, and behavior of vertebrates, leading to evolutionary responses.
3. Humidity: Humidity levels can influence water balance, desiccation tolerance, and habitat selection of vertebrates, which in turn can shape their phenotypic characteristics.
4. Seasonality: Seasonal changes in climate, including temperature fluctuations, rainfall patterns, and photoperiod, can drive seasonal migrations, hibernation, reproductive timing, and other phenological traits in vertebrates.
5. Solar radiation: Solar radiation affects thermoregulation, vitamin D synthesis, and overall energy budgets of vertebrates, potentially influencing their physiological and phenotypic responses.
6. Extreme events: Extreme climatic events, such as heatwaves, droughts, or storms, can exert strong selective pressures on vertebrates, leading to rapid phenotypic changes and adaptations.

Materials and methods
Phylogeny
To extract the rate evolution of body size (Frogs) and body mass (Squamates, mammals and birds) of vertebrates, we used the most comprehensive tree available in the literature for each group. We adopted this approach because the Atlantic Forest species pool did not evolve independently of other sister species that may occur in other biogeographical formations. For this reason, excluding and selecting only the pool of target species could impact evolution estimates (CIT?!). In this context, we use the phylogeny with the most comprehensive trees as possible to infer evolutionary rates.
We utilized four trees for each taxonomic group in our study. The consensus tree by Jetz & Pyron (2018), which includes 7,239 amphibian species. The fully-sampled consensus tree by Tonini et al. (2016), encompassing 9,754 squamate species. For mammals, we utilized the fully-sampled tree provided by Upham et al. (2019) with 4175 species. In the case of birds, since a consensus tree was not available, we followed the approach of Rubolini et al. (2015) and generated 10,000 posterior trees for the 9,993 bird species using the 'Hackett' backbone proposed by Jetz et al. (2012). Subsequently, we constructed a maximum clade credibility topology (MCCT) using the DendroPy and SumTrees (Sukumaran and Holder, 2010) packages using Python.

Trait data
We obtained data on body size for amphibia, and body mass for squamates, birds and mammals from the following sources: i) amphiBIO (Oliveira et al., 2017) and Vasconcelos et al. (2019) for frogs; ii) Guedes et al. (2023) for squamates; iii) AVONET (Tobias et al., 2022) for birds; and iv) Elton Traits (Wilman et al., 2014) for mammals, and complement with PanTHERIA (Jones et al., 2009) and Phylacine (Faurby et al. 2018). After compiling the trait data, we pruned the trait data and phylogeny using the package Picante (Kembel et al., 2010). However, 786 amphibians species (~11%), 268 squamates (~3%), and 322 mammal species (~8%) were not present in the phylogenies and were excluded from the analyzes. Furthermore, 1400 amphibian (~21%) and 82 mammalian (~2%) species had no body size/body mass data available. Therefore, we imputed trait data for these species. We chose to use phylogenetic imputation methods that perform well for macroecological studies. In addition, our data have adequate assumptions because they consist of continuous variables (body mass and body size) and represent <25% of the database (Johnson et al., 2020).
Firstly, we fitted alternative evolutionary models (Brownian motion, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, and Early Burst) to body size/body mass using the geiger R package (Pennell 268 et al., 2014) for 5,053 species for amphibians and 3,771 species for mammals. The best fit model was Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) for both groups. After that, we used this model to conduct data imputation in the RPhyloPars package (Goolsby et al., 2017). Thus, our final dataset contained 6,453 amphibians, 9,487 squamates, 9,993 birds, and 3853 non-flying mammal species. Our final dataset corresponds to ~75% of amphibian richness (8646 species in Frost, 2023), ~82% of reptiles (11,549 species in Reptile DataBase, 2022), ~91% of birds (10,906 species in Birds of the World, 2023), and ~76% of mammals (5,084 excluding Chiroptera species in Upham et al., 2023) known to occur in the world. 

Rate of phenotypic evolution 
        We further estimated rates of phenotypic evolution using the software BAMM v.2.5.0 (Bayesian analysis of macroevolutionary mixture; Rabosky, 2014). BAMM was selected due to its advantages in comparison with other methods (e.g. Cooney and Thomas, 2021; Barreto et al., 2023). For example, BAMM allows the modeling of evolutionary rates over time and between clades, detecting the heterogeneity of these rates. Furthermore, it is able to detect important innovations, rate changes and diversity dependence in phylogenetic trees. In addition, it is computationally efficient, allowing it to deal with large sets of phylogenetic data . Firstly, we use the 'BAMMtools' R package to generate the control file, including priors and other parameter estimates for each group (Rabosky et al., 2014). For rate trait diversification analysis in BAMM, we set the rate of change before γ = 1 and sampled the models every 1000 generations for a total of 12 million generations for amphibians and birds, 45 million generations for squamates and 10 million generations for mammals. All groups used a burn-in of 25% of generations. The number of generations and burn-in used to estimate the evolutionary rates of the traits varied and were chosen based on visual inspection of the log-likelihood of the MCMC output and the effect  of sample sizes (greater than or equal to 200). After this process, we extract the rates from the posterior distribution to obtain the values of the phenotypic rate evolution for each specie using getTipRates function and plotRateThroughTime function to visualize the of the rate evolution through the time.

Composition list
Similar to first chapter, using the letsR package (Vilela and Villalobos, 2015) in R, we obtained our species list building a presence-absence matrices separately for each group of vertebrates by overlaying species occurrence polygons on a 10x10 km grid with 0.5º cells, totaling 432 community samples (or squares). we considered a species to be present in a cell if at least 50% of the species' polygon covered the cell. We utilized the consensus extent of the Atlantic Forest proposed by Muylaert et al. (2018) to determine species occurrence in domain. We obtained occurrence amphibian data from IUCN (2021) and complemented with shapefiles from Vasconcelos et al. (2019). Squamates data occurrence was sourced from Roll et al. (2017), while bird occurrence data from BirdLife (2015), and mammals from IUCN (2021). Our species pool comprised native and non-migrating species across the entire Atlantic Forest. In total, our presence-absence matrices included 518 frog species, 402 squamates, 815 birds, and 236 mammals.
        Finally, we merged our species list with the rates of phenotipic evolution for each species calculated in the BAMM. However, 54 species of frogs (~10%), 34 species of squamates (~9%), 120 birds (~15%) and 42 mammals (~14%) were not sampled in respectives phylogenies and for this reason are not included in our analysis. Our final dataset corresponds to ~89% of amphibian richness (707 species), ~91% of reptiles (492 species), ~68% of birds (1025 species), and ~74% of mammals (262 species) known to occur in the Atlantic Forest (Figueiredo et al., 2021). 

Climatic niche
We use the PALEO-PGEM-Series, a global dataset that provides spatio-temporal (1° × 1°) information on climate variables dating to 5 Myr, with bioclimatic variables available at 1 kyr resolution (Barreto et al., 2023). This dataset offers detailed climate data and is derived from emulations performed with an atmosphere-ocean general circulation model. In our study, we specifically focus only data from the past 5 Myr (Plio-Pleistocene). By incorporating this database, we can assess the climatic niche of species using the oldest available climatic variables in the literature (Barreto et al., 2023). This enables us to investigate the relationship between species evolution and past climate conditions, contributing to a better understanding of the connections between biodiversity and climate. This is particularly valuable for studying the macroevolutionary processes of species, as these processes occur over extended periods of time. For comparative purposes, we also use the present climate data from CHELSA (0,5° × 0,5°; Brun et al., 2022) correspond to the mean of their collection period, between the years 1981–2010. In order to obtain the climatic variables throughout the Atlantic Forest space, we used the raster package in R software and extracted the bioclimatic mean for each grid square.
Factors such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, and seasonality can directly affect morphological, physiological, and behavioral aspects of organisms (Li et al., 2016; Saberi-Pirooz et al., 2021). Thus, variations in climatic variables through the space can influence trait evolution such as body size, growth rate, among others (Wen and Fu, 2020; Gvodk et al., 2010; Jaffe et al., 2016). For this reason, we have chosen six bioclimatic variables that potential impact on the evolution of trait rates in vertebrates. Furthermore, we chose the six bioclimatic variables that were present in both datasets: Mean annual air temperature (BIO1), Temperature Seasonality (BIO4), Temperature Annual Range (BIO7), Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter (BIO11), Precipitation Seasonality (BIO15), and Precipitation of Driest Quarter (BIO17). To identify and handling with potential multicollinearity between variables, we use the usdm package and Variation Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis to identify values >3. We excluded BIO04, BIO07, and BIO11 from the past data (PALEO-PGEM-Series) and the BIO01 and BIO11 from the present data (CHELSA). After that, we extract the mean of each climate variable for the grid used to make the composition matrix.
With the selected climate data, we extract niche indices for past and present data. we chose to represent the breadth and position of the species' climatic niche using the Outlying Mean Index (OMI). The OMI analysis is an ordination technique specifically developed to consider and incorporate the ecological niche of species within a community (Dolédec et al., 2000). In this way, it is possible to obtain insights into the tolerance (Tol) and the centrality (OMI) of the species' niche, distinguishing between generalist taxa that tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions and specialist taxa that are limited to specific climatic conditions. We obtained this index using the ade4 package (Dray and Dufour, 2007) in the R software. As the climatic variables have different measurement units, the 'scale' and 'center' arguments of the ‘dudi.pca’ function were set to 'True' to standardize the scale between the variables (Legendre and Galagher, 2001). 

Statistical analysis
To test the influence of the species' climatic niche on the rate of phenotypic evolution (rate_phenotipic_evolution ~ OMI_present + OMI_past + Tol_present + Tol_past), we employed a Phylogenetic Analysis of Generalized Least Squares (PGLS). This analysis consists of Generalized Linear Models (GLS) that incorporate a covariance matrix capturing the phylogenetic relationships between the studied species. In this analysis, it adjusts the residuals of the linear model according to the phylogenetic structure within each group. We conducted a total of four PGLS models (one for each group) using the nlme package and extracting the regression coefficients (R2) using the rr2 package in R software. To deal with the phylogenetic correlation, we use corPagel function in our PGLS models.

Results
Rate evolution of body size (amphibians) and body mass (squamates, birds and mammals) through-time trajectories for terrestrial vertebrates. Trait rate indicates the evolution rates of body size/body mass for the broader tree known, indicating the trend of adaptive radiation of vertebrates in the world. The blue density shading illustrates the relative probability of a rate at any point in time and the red line indicates the evolutionary trajectory of body size/body mass. 
Evolution dynamics of body size and body mass of terrestrial vertebrates that occur in the Atlantic Forest domain. Warmer colors (yellow) denote faster rates of trait evolution, cold colors (blue) indicate slower rates.  In general, it is possible to note that the faster evolutionary rates are more concentrated and distributed among the ectotherm lineages when compared to the endotherms. 
Phylogenetic Analysis of Generalized Least Squares (PGLS) of each group of vertebrates from the Atlantic Forest and the respective coefficients (black dots) and confidence intervals (dashed line). OMI represents the position of the climatic niche in the present (OMI present) and in the past (OMI past), that is, the centrality of the climatic space in which the species occurs. Likewise, the climatic niche breadth is represented in the present (Tolerance present) and in the past (Tolerance past). Although no relationship tested was significant (P > 0.05), it is possible to observe that the climatic niche breadth has a greater effect in all groups of vertebrates when compared to the position of the niche.

First, we chose the most comprehensive species tree known for each terrestrial vertebrate group, as well as using the respective broader databases with amphibian body size, and body mass of squamates, birds and mammals. After that, we estimate the evolutionary rates for each group using BAMM (Bayesian analysis of macroevolutionary mixture; Rabosky, 2014) and then extract these rates for each species to obtain the phenotypic evolutionary rate. To access the climatic niche of each species, we consulted two temporal-spatially explicit climate databases (Present in CHELSA database in Brun et al., 2022 and past PALEO-PGEM-Series in Barreto et al., 2023). We extract the mean of each climate variable for the grid used to make the species composition matrix of vertebrates in Atlantic Forest. After that, we extract niche indices for past and present data. We chose to represent the breadth and position of the species' climatic niche using the Outlying Mean Index (OMI). Finally, to test the influence of the species' climatic niche on the rate of phenotypic evolution (rate_phenotipic_evolution ~ OMI_present + OMI_past + Tol_present + Tol_past), we employed a Phylogenetic Analysis of Generalized Least Squares (PGLS).
